**Deliverables:** scanner CLI, pipeline action, reporting dashboard.

---

### 3) **ATH-X — Autonomous Threat Hunting (MVP → full)**  
**What:** Logs ingestion pipeline → parser → detection rules → alerts → triage dashboard (Streamlit). Foundation for ML evolution.  
**Impact:** Reproducible SIEM flow demo — ideal for SOC/Threat Hunting roles and technical assessments.  
**Tech:** Python, log parsing, SQLite/Postgres, Streamlit, tests and CI.  
**Deliverables:** working demo, synthetic dataset, automated triage playbook.

---

### 4) **NetSentinel — Real-time Network Forensics & Exfiltration Detector**  
**What:** Synthetic traffic generator, flow aggregation and exfiltration detectors (user-space eBPF concepts).  
**Impact:** Rule testing and signal validation for real-time exfiltration scenarios.  
**Tech:** Go/Python, pcap/flow handling, user-space probes, dashboards.  
**Deliverables:** traffic generator, detection module, event visualizer.

---

### 5) **IAMProof — Formal Policy Verifier for Cloud IAM**  
**What:** IAM policy parser + formal analysis (model checking) to identify privilege escalation paths.  
**Impact:** Prevents insecure cloud configurations before deployment; audit tool for policies.  
**Tech:** Python, TLA+/Z3, automated reports.  
**Deliverables:** policy validator, example auto-fixes and reporting.

---

### 6) **ICS-Shield — ICS Emulation & Secure HIL Lab**  
**What:** Emulated environment for industrial protocols (Modbus, OPC UA) with scenarios and anomaly detectors.  
**Impact:** Platform to test detection and response in OT/ICS — high value for critical infrastructure security.  
**Tech:** Modbus/OPC simulators, Python, detection engines, telemetry.  
**Deliverables:** emulated lab, reproducible scenarios, detection metrics.

---

### 7) **IDSHIELD — Integrated Defensive Simulation & Research Platform (Capstone)**  
**What:** Integration of previous projects — signal fusion, testable playbooks, SBOM checks, formal verification and synthetic datasets.  
**Impact:** Research-grade platform demonstrating end-to-end defense: detection through automated response.  
**Tech:** Microservices (Node/Python), message bus, orchestration, synthetic datasets.  
**Deliverables:** integrated platform, benchmarking scripts and technical whitepaper.

---

## ⚡ How I work (workflow)
1. **Quickstart & reproducibility:** everything I deliver includes a 3-step quickstart, containerization where relevant and CI.  
2. **Test driven & runbooks:** automated tests + operational runbook (how to reproduce / mitigate).  
3. **Clear documentation:** README with examples, short demo video and interview checklist.  
4. **Accelerated learning:** I can study and obtain certificates quickly when a role requires — I guarantee consistent delivery even on new stacks.
